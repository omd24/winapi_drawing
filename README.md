Drawing lines and circles using WinApi/Win32

## About
A legacy pet project from good-ol' days when I started watching [Handmade Hero series](https://handmadehero.org/).

This is just to test how with just a few lines of code using WinApi/Win32 we can draw lines and circles.

## Inputs

- Press "C" to draw circles
- Press "L" to draw lines
